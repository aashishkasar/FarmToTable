In this project, I contributed to the development of a conversational AI interface using Streamlit and Google's Gemini API. Here’s a summary of my contributions:

1. *API Integration*: I configured the Gemini API by handling the API key loading from a local file and setting up the GenerativeModel instance for AI response generation.

2. *Streamlit Web App Setup*: I established the basic structure of the Streamlit web app, including setting the page title, icon, and layout. Additionally, I added a styled header to enhance the visual appeal of the interface.

3. *Chat Interface Implementation*: I designed the chat interface where users can interact with the AI assistant. This included managing the conversation flow, displaying messages, and persisting the chat history using Streamlit’s session state.

4. *User Input Handling*: I implemented the logic to capture user input, append it to the chat history, and trigger AI response generation.

5. *AI Response Management*: I facilitated the communication between the user and the AI assistant by processing user queries, sending them to the Gemini model for response generation, and displaying the AI-generated responses in the chat interface.

6. *Enhancing User Experience*: I focused on ensuring a smooth user experience by incorporating features like message loading spinners to indicate processing and maintaining a clear record of the conversation for users to reference.

My contributions were aimed at creating a functional and engaging conversational AI interface that provides users with a seamless experience while interacting with the Gemini AI assistant. I worked on both the technical implementation aspects and the user experience considerations to deliver a polished and effective solution.
